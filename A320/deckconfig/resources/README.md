# Toliss A321 Airbus Streamdecks Configuration

This is a personal layout file for the Airbus A321.

It mainly represents buttons
1. On the FCU
1. On the piedestal
1. On the overhead panel

I own both a 15 and a 32 Stream Deck, so I made a full layout for each.
I also own a X-Touch mini

Those three devices are extremely verstile and can be used for numerous purposes.

Presentation and layout is always a matter of taste and habits, but hopefully,
it should not be too difficult to adjust to your preferences.

It may work on other Toliss Airbus.
Isn't that the principle of Airbus?
Once you can fly one of their planes, you can fly them all.

# Design notes

There are 2 types of icons:

Flat icon a simple gradient background.

Button icons represent a button and have texts and highlight variation to them.

Whenever I have time, I make an ON and an OFF version of each individual icon, so than you can barely see the text when it is off.
