BUG:
Word FORMULA appears in managed altitude?


To do:
Add ability to choose color from dataref value



---

Think about more flexibility for TEXT icon. Allow different version?
1. Version selection: 0, 1, 2... => index in array
2. Each version as different set of text-*

Make kind of "multi-texts" selector.

Examples:
Airspeed: Knots vs. Mach indication

Altitude: Feet/Meters
Vertical speed: Ft/m or angle of descend.

Rather than default color for cockpit, use a defaul background image with texture
