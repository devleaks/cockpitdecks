The X-Touch Mini's documentation for changing LED values works as expected only for Standard Mode.

Mackie Control emulation is meant so that X-Touch can be used with every music program (legacy). Here's the only Mackie Control documentation I have found.

The original Mackie Control only had 11 LEDs for Knobs, therefore 2 LEDs won't be controllable in the X-Touch. See 'V-Pot rings' in the MC documentation (values are in hex).

Button LEDs

Note:

Same as the input note when pressing down the button.
40-45, 84-95
Velocity:

0 = OFF
1 = BLINK
127 = ON
Example:

ShortMessage(NOTE_ON, 0, note, velocity);
As noted by CL.'s answer use the constant NOTE_ON (144). You are currently providing 8 which is an invalid command.

Knob LEDs

CC (Control Change):

48-55
Value:

0 = OFF
1-11 = SINGLE
17-27 = TRIM
33-43 = FAN
49-54 = SPREAD
Example:

ShortMessage(CONTROL_CHANGE, 0, cc, value);
